# AIRLINE_REGISTRATION
The user will use this project to purchase airline tickets for travel to several nations.
and they will receive the airline ticket after the booking is confirmed. 
In this project, several C++ concepts—such as structures, classes, objects, i/o files, etc.—are applied.

There is a class called-Details, which takes input from the user about their name, gender
phoneno, their ID.

Another class is registration, which gives the option of 6 countries 
and the details of the flight, flight number, date,time and duration of the flight.

The next class ticket, shows the ticket in "records.txt" file after the booking is confirmed.
